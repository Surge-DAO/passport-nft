  aboutSurgeDescription: `Surge is a female-led community, focused on educating and securing
  women's place in Web3.

  A group of us met in Kernel in September, 2021 and have since launched Surge Women where we are publishing educational content.

  We know the language in Crypto is intimidating, so we are changing the information pipeline with easily digestible content.

  Our mission is to bring more women into the space and fix the gender imbalance.
