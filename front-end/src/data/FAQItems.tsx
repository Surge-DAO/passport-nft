    question: 'How do I mint my NFT?',
    answer: `When we say “mint” we mean buying the NFT.

    Using generative algorithms to generate these NFTs means that we have attributes that will automagically get paired together through our algorithm.
    When you mint, this calls on the algorithm to start generating its next creation.`
  }, 
  {
    question: 'What happens if I miss the mint date? Or it sells out?',
    answer: `Don’t you worry! When the mint closes, it just means the generative algorithm won’t generate 
    new NFTs, but it doesn’t mean you can’t buy a Surge Passport. 

    You can always purchase one through secondary sales on [Open Sea](https://opensea.io) or Coinbase.`
  }, 
  {
    question: 'What NFT platforms can I view my NFT on?',
    answer: `Currently, we’re only on OpenSea and Coinbase. However, we’re opening up to other
    platforms soon.`
  },  
  {
    question: 'Can I sell my NFT?',
    answer: `Of course. Just keep in mind that when you sell the NFT, you also loose access to the perks.

    You can resell through one of the marketplaces the NFT is hosted on: Open Sea, Coinbase, etc.`

  {
    question: 'What happens to my perks when I sell my NFT?',

    answer: `You go to your Perks Dashboard.`
  },  
  {
    question: 'How do I check my NFT rarity?',
