    question: 'How do I mint my NFT?',
    answer: `When we say “mint” we mean buying the NFT.

    Using generative algorithms to create these NFTs means that we have attributes that will algorithmically get paired together and stored in decentralized storage.
    For each NFT you mint, we’ll send you a randomly generated one directly to your address.`
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I miss the mint date? Or it sells out?',
    answer: `Don’t you worry! When the mint closes, it just means the generative algorithm won’t generate new NFTs, but it doesn’t mean you can’t buy a Surge Passport.

    You can always purchase one through secondary sales on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/surge-passport" style="color: #f86464;" target=”_blank”>OpenSea</a>.`
  },
  {
    question: 'What NFT platforms can I view my NFT on?',
    answer: `Currently, we’re on <a href="https://opensea.io" style="color: #f86464;" target=”_blank”>OpenSea</a> and opening up to other platforms soon.`
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I resell my NFT?',
    answer: `Of course. Just keep in mind that when you sell the NFT, you also lose access to the perks.

    You can resell through <a href="https://opensea.io" style="color: #f86464" target=”_blank”>OpenSea</a>.`

  {
    question: 'How do I make sure my NFT is protected?',
    answer: `<ul> <li> Make sure you store your wallet’s seed phrase somewhere safe. We recommend this to be offline- pen and paper for the win here!</li>
    <li>Never reveal your seed phrase to anyone for any reason.</li>
    <li>Store your NFT in a wallet protected by a physical wallet, like Ledger, for an extra layer of protection.</li>
    <li>Store your NFTs in a “bunker wallet” - an address that you don’t use to interact with any sites. This address should be used only to store your most valuable NFTs in.</li></ul>`

  {
    question: 'What happens to my unclaimed perks when I sell my NFT?',

  },
  {
    question: 'How do I claim my perks?',
    answer: `By accessing the Perks Dashboard you’ll be able to check out all available perks and claim them through connecting your wallet.`
