    answer: `New to NFTs? No worries, here are some steps on what you need to do to get
     your Roboto.

    Download the <b>metamask.io</b> extension for the Chrome/Brave browser or app on 
    mobile. This will allow you to make purchases with Ethereum and can be found in 
    the extensions tab. If you are on mobile, you must use the Metamask App
    Browser
    
    You can purchase Ethereum through the Metamask Wallet using Wyre or Send 
    Ethereum from an exchange like <b>Coinbase</b>.
    
    Click on Connect at the top of the page and connect your Metamask. Once joined,
    you will be able to purchase the NFTs in the mint section. You will be prompted to
    sign your transaction. FYI, there will be a fee associated with every transaction
    related to gas prices.
