## Local Development

### Running Locally in a Docker Container (_recommended_)

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/). (You do not need to create an account in order to use Docker.)
2. Run the following command:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view app in the browser. 

This simulates how the app will be built in production.
This workflow builds from the package-lock.json file using `npm ci`. 
If any dependencies change, you will need to run `npm install` separately to update the lock file before running `docker-compose up`.


#### Troubleshooting Docker
`docker-compose up` does not rebuild images before starting up a container to save time.
If you are having issues with your container or certain changes are not propagating, then run
`docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`. This will rebuild the image and recreate the container.

### Running Locally using NPM

1. `npm install` to install all dependencies

### Available Scripts

```
npm run compile # compile the contracts
npm run start   # start the front end
npm run test    # run tests on contracts and front end
npm run format  # run prettier
```
