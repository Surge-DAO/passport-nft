## Local Development

### Running Locally in a Docker Container (_recommended_)

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/). (You do not need to create an account in order to use Docker.)
2. Run the following command:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view app in the browser. 

This simulates how the app will be built in production.
This workflow builds from the package-lock.json file using `npm ci`. 
If any dependencies change, you will need to run `npm install` separately to update the lock file before running `docker-compose up`.


#### Troubleshooting Docker
`docker-compose up` does not rebuild images before starting up a container to save time.
If you are having issues with your container or certain changes are not propagating, then run
`docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`. This will rebuild the image and recreate the container.

### Running Locally using NPM

1. `npm install` to install all dependencies

### Available Scripts

```
npm run compile # compile the contracts
npm run start   # start the front end
npm run test    # run tests on contracts and front end
npm run format  # run prettier
```


## Deployment

For our merge and deployment process, we are following a variation of the [Gitflow branching model](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow). 
The `develop` branch represents our test environment and the `main` branch represents our prod environment.

Follow the diagram below for merging and deployments:

```mermaid
  graph LR
     A[feature branch] -- Open PR against develop <br/> After approval, merge to develop
     --> B[develop] -- Check site in test env <br/> If changes look good, open PR against main <br/> Merge to main 
     --> C[main]
